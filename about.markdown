## Bio
My name is Brendan Inglis, and I am a Mechanical Engineering PhD student at Lehigh University. After graduating from Lehigh with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2019, my interest in biomechanics and applications of mechanical engineering to biotechnology led me to B. Braun Medical Inc. in Allentown PA where I worked for 2 years. During this time, I received an offer to return to school and research bone biomechanics with [Professor Hannah Dailey's](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/hannah-dailey) lab. My research areas of interest include Finite Element Analysis, biomedical image processing and analysis, and large-scale simulations run on Lehigh's [High Performance Computing Center (HPC)](https://lts.lehigh.edu/services/high-performance-computing-hpc-research-computing).

In my spare time, I am interested in music and athletics among other things. I enjoy tinkering with musical instruments by experimenting with microprocessors and software. I enjoy seeing my ideas come to life, from a concept in my head to a physical working prototype. This also applies to writing original music and recording myself and my friends playing music together, or playing in the jazz combo at Lehigh. In the summers, I enjoy hiking and camping in the Lehigh valley, and in the winters I play pickup basketball in Allentown and snowboard. 

## Leadership
### Dailey Lab Research Lead
As a graduate student in Lehigh's Dailey Lab, I was often tasked with leading projects concerning new avenues of research or with being the main contributor to ongoing projects. I delegated responsibilities, shared time-consuming/manual tasks, and pioneered new technical approaches to solve the challenges of the research question at hand. I mentored summer lab students and research-for-credit semester-long students, training them in ANSYS and in other medical imaging analysis software. I trained two new PhD students joining the lab for the remaining weeks before I graduated as well. During my time with the lab I was the first author on [two publications](https://bji219.github.io/Research/) and was a significant contributor to at least 3 other research projects. 
 
### Mechanics Teaching Assistant 
While I was mainly supported by grant funding during my time in graduate school, I also taught as a TA for a semester in a sophomore Mechanics class. I graded weekly quizes for all 50+ students and ran a weekly office hours homework help session to tutor struggling or inquisitive students. I maintained the class Coursesite (similar to Moodle or Coursicle) grade page and uploaded quiz and homework grades regularly in collaboration with the teaching professor.
 
### Extra Credit Lab Design and Supervision
My advisor Hannah Dailey and I on designed and ran an undergraduate [extra credit lab](https://bji219.github.io/Research#bone-tensile-testing-lab) for the same above-mentioned Mechanics class. I created a simple image analysis program to supplement the benchtop mechanical testing. I also directly supervised the students who participated in the lab and ran the Zwick/collected the data for distribution after the lab was complete. Finally, my professor and I co-graded the assignments.
