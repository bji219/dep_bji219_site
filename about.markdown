My name is Brendan Inglis, and I am a Mechanical Engineering PhD student at Lehigh University. After graduating from Lehigh with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2019, my interest in biomechanics and applications of mechanical engineering to biotechnology led me to B. Braun Medical Inc. in Allentown PA where I worked for 2 years. During this time, I received an offer to return to school and research bone biomechanics with [Professor Hannah Dailey's](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/hannah-dailey) lab. My research areas of interest include Finite Element Analysis, biomedical image processing and analysis, and large-scale simulations run on Lehigh's [High Performance Computing Center (HPC)](https://lts.lehigh.edu/services/high-performance-computing-hpc-research-computing).

In my spare time, I am interested in music and athletics among other things. I enjoy tinkering with musical instruments by experimenting with microprocessors and software. I enjoy seeing my ideas come to life, from a concept in my head to a physical working prototype. This also applies to writing original music and recording myself and my friends playing music together, or playing in the jazz combo at Lehigh. In the summers, I enjoy hiking and camping in the Lehigh valley, and in the winters I play pickup basketball in Allentown and snowboard.
