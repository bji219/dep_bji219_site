This page serves as a place holder for adding projects that I have completed or worked on during my time at Lehigh university.

### Newton-Raphson Iteration Root Finder Art 
As a project in my Numerical Methods in Engineering course, we were tasked with creating fractal art using the Newton-Raphson root finding technique. We programmed the method in Matlab, and chose a higher-order polynomial in order to produce the interesting root behavior that we wanted to capture. 

Newton Raphson iterative method:
`x(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)`

Function in Matlab:
```matlab
function[x0,n,fx] = fractals_1(f,fprime,x0)
    %maximum iterations
    nmax = 1000;
    %convergence control
    delta = 0.5*10^-6;
    %allowable error threshold
    epsilon = 0.5*10^-6;
    %initial value of function
    fx = f(x0);
    
    for n = 1:nmax    
        %counts which iteration we are on
        n = (n-1)+1;
        %Solves the derivative at the guess point
        fp = fprime(x0);
       
        if abs(fp) < delta 
           display('Small derivative')
        end
        
        %f(x)/f'(x), crucial step in NR
        d = fx/fp;
        %finds new guess
        x0 = x0-d;
        %Tells the loop to use the new x0 root guess
        fx = f(x0);
        
        if abs(d) < epsilon         
            %display('Convergence!')  
            %Will return to the invoking function when error limit reached
            return   
        end 
    end 
end
```

The roots that were returned were mapped to the real roots of the higher-order polynomial and were contour-plotted in Matlab (a few interesting results are displayed below):

### Double-Pendulum 
The final for our Numerical Methods in Engineering course was to create a model of a double-pendulum system. We used the lengths of the pendulum arms, the mass of each ball, acceleration due to gravity, and the initial angle of the system as the inputs of an IVP (initial value problem) composed of the equations of motion for the pendulums (angular position and velocity etc.). Using the [Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta%E2%80%93Fehlberg_method), we solved the initial value problem using Matlab and recorded the incremental solutions over time to create an animation of the system. 

Double-pendulum system of equations:
```matlab
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Function Inputs: 
% paramset: array of physical constants for the double pendulum
% t: independent variable (in this case, time)
% y: dependent variable array 

% Function Output: 
% yprime: array defining the system of equations
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
function[yprime] = doublependulum(paramset,t,y) 

l1 = paramset(1);
l2 = paramset(2); 
m1 = paramset(3);
m2 = paramset(4);
g = paramset(5);

%Simplify system of eqns. 
a = (m1+m2)*l1;
b = @(t,x) m2*l2*cos(x(1)-x(3));
c = @(t,x) m2*l1*cos(x(1)-x(3));
d = m2*l2;
e = @(t,x) -m2*l2*(x(4)^2)*sin(x(1)-x(3))-g*(m1+m2)*sin(x(1));
f = @(t,x) m2*l1*(x(2)^2)*sin(x(1)-x(3))-m2*g*sin(x(3));

%System of ODEs:
%x(1) = theta1
%x(2) = theta_dot1
%x(3) = theta2
%x(4) = theta_dot2

yprime = cell(length(y),1);
%The equivalent 1st order ODE Eqn. for: Theta1
yprime{1,1} = @(t,x) x(2);

%Eqv 1st order ODE for Theta_dot1 ((ed)-(bf))/((ad)-(cb)), working on cleaning up
yprime{2,1} = @(t,x) (((-m2*l2*(x(4)^2)*sin(x(1)-x(3))-g*(m1+m2)*sin(x(1)))*...
(d)) - ((m2*l2*cos(x(1)-x(3)))*(m2*l1*(x(2)^2)*sin(x(1)-x(3))-m2*g*sin(x(3)))))/...
(((a)*(d)) - ((m2*l1*cos(x(1)-x(3)))*(m2*l2*cos(x(1)-x(3)))));
 
%Eqv 1st order ODE for Theta2
yprime{3,1} = @(t,x) x(4);

%Eqv 1st order ODE for Theta_dot2 (af-ce)/(ad-cb), working on cleaning up
yprime{4,1} = @(t,x) (((a)*(m2*l1*(x(2)^2)*sin(x(1)-x(3))-m2*g*sin(x(3))))-...
    ((m2*l1*cos(x(1)-x(3)))*(-m2*l2*(x(4)^2)*sin(x(1)-x(3))-g*(m1+m2)*sin(x(1)))))/...
    (((a)*(d)) - ((m2*l1*cos(x(1)-x(3)))*(m2*l2*cos(x(1)-x(3)))));
end
```

RK-45 snippet (constants c20, c30 etc. not shown for brevity, code widely available online):
```matlab
for j = 1:length(yprime)
    %From widely available pseudocode adapted for ODE system
    K1(1,j) = h*yprime{j}(t,x);
    K2(1,j) = h*yprime{j}(t+c20*h,x+c21*K1(1,j));
    K3(1,j) = h*yprime{j}(t+c30*h,x+c31*K1(1,j)+c32*K2(1,j));
    K4(1,j) = h*yprime{j}(t+c40*h,x+c41*K1(1,j)+c42*K2(1,j)+c43*K3(1,j));
    K5(1,j) = h*yprime{j}(t+h,x+c51*K1(1,j)+c52*K2(1,j)+c53*K3(1,j)+c54*K4(1,j));
    K6(1,j) = h*yprime{j}(t+c60*h,x+c61*K1(1,j)+c62*K2(1,j)+c63*K3(1,j)+c64*K4(1,j)+c65*K5(1,j));
end

% weighted averages
x4= x + a1*K1 + a3*K3 + a4*K4 + a5*K5;
x = x + b1*K1 + b3*K3 + b4*K4 + b5*K5 + b6*K6;

%iterates the time step
t = t + h;

%calculates the error value to compare in adaptive time step
epsilon = abs(x-x4);

%assuming worst case w/max to send back to the variable time stepper
epsilon = max(epsilon);
```
