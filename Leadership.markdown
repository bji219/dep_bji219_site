## Dailey Lab Research Lead
As a graduate student in Lehigh's Dailey Lab, I was often tasked with leading projects concerning new avenues of research or with being the main contributor to ongoing projects. I delegated responsibilities, shared time-consuming/manual tasks, and poineered new technical approaches to solve the challenges of the research question at hand. I mentored summer lab students and research-for-credit semester-long students, training them in ANSYS and in other medical imaging analysis software. I trained two new PhD students joining the lab for the remaining weeks before I graduated as well. During my time with the lab I was the first author on [two publications](https://bji219.github.io/Research/) and was a significant contributor to at least 3 other research projects. 

## Mechanics Teaching Assistant 
While I was mainly supported by grant funding during my time in graduate school, I also taught as a TA for a semester in a sophomore Mechanics class. I graded weekly quizes for all 50+ students and ran a weekly office hours homework help session to tutor struggling or inquisitive students. I maintained the class Coursesite (similar to Moodle or Coursicle) grade page and uploaded quiz and homework grades regularly in collaboration with the teaching professor.

## Extra Credit Lab Design and Supervision
My advisor Hannah Dailey and I on designed and ran an undergraduate [extra credit lab](#bone-tensile-testing-lab) for the same above-mentioned Mechanics class. I created a simple image analysis program to supplement the benchtop mechanical testing. I also directly supervised the students who participated in the lab and ran the Zwick/collected the data for distribution after the lab was complete. Finally, my professor and I co-graded the assignments.
