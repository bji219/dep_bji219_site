# Wireless Vinyl Record Player
The slogan of my maker-enterprise would propably go something like: "Brendan Inglis, making things that already exist in a more complicated way since 1996". People might say - why not just buy a bluetooth record player? Why not just use audio cables to connect the record player to the speakers? To these people I reply, "Because". 

## Workflow
### Record Player --> LogicPro --> Airplay --> Raspberry Pi --> Focusrite 2i2 --> Speakers

### Shairplay Sync Spotify 
At the end of the day, this was actually a pretty simple project. I used [this great repository](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) called Shairplay-Sync from Mike Brady (thanks Mike). This essentially adds the capability to act as an Airplay receiver to the Raspberry Pi. It worked great out of the box!
