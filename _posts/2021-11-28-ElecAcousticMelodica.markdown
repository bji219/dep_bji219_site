# Constructing an Electric-Acoustic Melodica

Inspired by my piano teacher Tim Harrison (a proficient flute and melodica player) and Jon Batiste (The Late Show band) I decided to buy a melodica. For about 5 or 6 years now, I have enjoyed playing my cheap Hohner 37-key instrument. I used to play the saxophone in grade school, and playing the melodica in the same style as Jon Batiste (almost like a trumpet) gives me a similarly satisfying feeling of expression that is a nice change-up from piano. 

In the fall I saw Steely Dan on their "Absolutely Normal '21" tour in Bethlehem, and I thought Donald Fagen was killing it on the electric-acoustic melodica. I was determined to see if I could create something similar on a budget with my own melodica. After stumbling across [this blog post](https://jakewildwood.blogspot.com/2020/07/workshop-diy-electric-melodica.html) (shout out to Jake Wildwood) which used the same make and model of melodica, I knew I was on to something. 

For Christmas, my siblings got me a Journey Instruments [piezo pickup system](https://www.amazon.com/Passive-Acoustic-Pickup-EP001K-Guitars/dp/B088K6431K/ref=asc_df_B088K6431K/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459643954788&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1577928950098337210&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9006949&hvtargid=pla-980612391063&psc=1) for acoustic guitars. This was the key piece of the puzzle to put the melodica together. A piezo pickup is essentially a piece of quartz (silicon dioxide) which will "squash" together when pressure is applied to it. If a circuit is built around a chunk of quartz, the voltage drop will change over the quartz as varying amounts of pressure are applied. This key property enables technology like piezo-pickups to be built.

I started by opening up my melodica and seeing what kind of clearance I had within the plastic housing. Based on the internal geometry and the size of the Journey Instruments quarter-inch jack, I decided to place the pickup near the back of the keys and route the wiring from there. Using a drill and soldering iron, I carefully created a hole to house the jack.

With the easy part completed, I needed to laboriously route the pickups to the sound chamber of the instrument. The bottom portion of the
