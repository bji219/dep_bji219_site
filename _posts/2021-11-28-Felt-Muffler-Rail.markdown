# Creating a DIY Felt Muffler Rail
As a piano player, it can be hard for me to keep my hands off the keys for long periods of time. When I received complaints from my family members about the loudness of the piano while they were working from home, I decided to take matters into my own hands and reduce the volume. Since my families parlor piano is acoustic, there is no volume control (see below). I decided to immitate the felt muffler rails that I have seen in upright pianos.

### Prototype 
To begin with, I had a small amount of felt, cardboard, a stapler, and my imagination. After measuring the length of the hammers inside the piano, I cut the felt strips to length. By laying them across the hammers, I could get an idea for where they would need to be attached to the rail and to the interior of the piano cabinet.

I stapled together the whole assembly and taped it into the rough position that I would want everything to go inside of the piano:

### Next Steps
Now that I have the concept hashed out, I need to purchase sturdier materials. First, I will need wider felt strips so that the hammers to not contact the rail. I will also need either thin plywood or a metal bar to attach the felt to. Lastly, I will need to design a mechanism for raising and lowering the muffler rail. I will take inspiration from existing rails rather than reinvent the wheel. 

### How does it sound? 
Even with a muffler rail made out of cardboard and staples, I think the resulting sound is pretty cool. Making the design more permanent with wider felt and sturdier construction will help remove the mechanical noise from the hammer strikes.
