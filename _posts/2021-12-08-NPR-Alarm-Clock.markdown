### NPR Alarm Clock
What better way to wake up than with NPR's [Morning Edition](https://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/)? I was inspired to make this project as a way to combine Python programming practice and my enjoyment of listening to NPR in the mornings. I used a cron job on my mac to run the python script each morning at 8:10am.
