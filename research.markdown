### About My Research at Lehigh University
I graduated with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Lehigh in May of 2019. After working for about two years at B. Braun Medical Inc. in Allentown PA, I received an offer to return to Lehigh to work in Professor Hannah Dailey's Lab. Professor Dailey's research focuses on modeling and predicting bone healing, and developing numerical and finite element methods for capturing the mechanical behavior of bone. 

### Biomechanical Duality of Fracture Healing 
The first paper that I contributed to in the lab focuses on how the material properties of bone are modeled in healing ovine tibiae. The hypothesis of the
